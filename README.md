This is a really simple calculator that I made while learning to use JavaFX and more specifically FXML. Everything is self-contained in a single class. Typically, this is a bad approach to design, but it was a simple enough project that it didn't seem to matter. If I were to add more functionality for some reason, I would refactor to reduce repetition.

If you stumbled on this and you want to learn a little about JavaFX or FXML, this is provided under the MIT license free of charge.
